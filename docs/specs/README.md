# windowctl — OpenSpec Specifications

**Source of truth:** [`docs/requirements.md`](../requirements.md) v0.1.

This folder slices the windowctl requirements into vertical, user-facing
capability specs in OpenSpec style. Each slice lives in its **own file**, is
self-contained (input → behavior → output), and references back to the
requirement IDs it covers.

Slices are numbered by **delivery value**, not by document order.
[`os-spikes`](./01-os-spikes.md) leads as the tracer-bullet foundation:
it proves each target OS can actually drive a real window before any
higher-level capability is built. Everything else builds on it.

## Architectural ground truth

From v1, the CLI has always been a thin wrapper over an internal library
package — every CLI command across these specs is implemented by delegating
to the library, not by reimplementing logic in the CLI layer. What was
**not** done initially was **exporting** that library as a public, importable
Go module. That export is a later capability and is captured in
[`go-library-api`](./07-go-library-api.md), whose status reflects this
split: the wrapper-shape and OS-mockable core have been in place from the
beginning, the public Go-module surface and dependency-isolation guarantee
came later.

Individual CLI specs do not restate "the CLI delegates to the library" in
every scenario — that is a global invariant covered once, here.

## Spec file conventions

Each slice file follows the same shape:

- **Front matter:** `Status`, `Source`, `Summary`.
- **`## Requirement: <name>`** — one per behavioral requirement in scope.
- **`### Scenario: <name>`** — Given/When/Then-style bullets under each
  requirement.
- **`## Tasks`** — small Taskfile-style table mapping the spec back to
  the `task <name>` command(s) that build, test, or otherwise verify
  it. Where no current task covers a part of the spec, that gap is
  called out explicitly under the table.

Status values match the index legend above. When a single spec mixes
implemented and planned requirements, per-requirement status is annotated
inline (e.g. *(Implemented from v1)* / *(Planned)*).
