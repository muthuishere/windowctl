# macOS real-window smoke test for windowctl.
#
# Mirrors scripts/smoke-windows.ps1: build the CLI, launch a real
# application (TextEdit), detect it via `windowctl windows list`,
# exercise `move`, and stop the app. Designed for the macos-latest
# GitHub Actions runner AND for local dev runs via `task smoke-darwin`.
#
# DEFAULT MODE (CI + first local run): no Accessibility permission is
# expected, so `windowctl move` MUST exit non-zero with an
# "Accessibility permission denied" message and the script asserts
# that as the success condition. This keeps the AX-denied path loud
# instead of silently green on a permission-less runner.
#
# OPT-IN AX MODE (local, after granting AX in System Settings):
# set WCTL_SMOKE_AX=1. The script will REQUIRE the granted path
# (move exits 0 AND a follow-up `windows list` reports TextEdit's
# bounds matching the requested rectangle within WCTL_AX_TOLERANCE
# pixels — defaults to 50, wide enough to absorb the macOS title-bar
# (~28px), window shadow, and any TextEdit-specific min-size or
# chrome-vs-content-area variance, but tight enough to catch a
# truly broken move).
#
# Without WCTL_SMOKE_AX=1 the script auto-detects from the move's
# actual outcome — useful because both macos-latest CI runners and
# developers' local Macs typically inherit Accessibility trust from
# the parent shell process, so a "fresh, AX-denied" runner is the
# exception rather than the default.
#
# We launch TextEdit via LaunchServices (`open -a TextEdit <file>`)
# rather than osascript / AppleScript — the whole point of this
# slice is to remove the off-spec AppleScript dependency. Touching
# the file path first sidesteps TextEdit's iCloud document picker,
# which can otherwise intercept `open` on a fresh user account.

# 5. Exercise `move`. Auto-detect the actual AX state from the move's
#    behavior — neither a developer's local Mac nor a macos-latest CI
#    runner has a stable "AX is not granted" guarantee, because both
#    inherit Accessibility trust from the parent shell process. Branch
#    on the real outcome:
#      - exit 0 → AX effectively granted; assert geometry within tolerance
#      - exit !=0 with "Accessibility permission denied" in stderr → AX
#        denied; assert that's the error
#      - anything else → genuinely unexpected, fail loud
#    WCTL_SMOKE_AX=1 is an opt-in strict mode that REQUIRES the granted
#    path (catches a regression where AX trust silently breaks on a
#    previously-trusted setup).
#
# Pre-settle before move: TextEdit's restore-state machinery can clobber
# AX position writes during the first ~1-2s after window creation.
# Always wait — denied path is harmless during this sleep too. Mirrors
# what Rectangle / yabai do.
